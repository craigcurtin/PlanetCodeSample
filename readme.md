# Planets Example in Python 3.7

This is a simple code sample gouged heavily from original C++ [Jay Jay Billing's repo](https://github.com/ornl-training/code-sample-examples/blob/master/planets-c%2B%2B/README.md). Jay Jay has written a pretty good blog post: [Jay Jay Billing's blog post](https://jayjaybillings.com/2018/01/31/what-does-a-good-code-sample-look-like/). 

This Python implementation computes the static gravitational potential of a configuration of celestial bodies. The configuration file (Data/planetary-system.csv) is completely random and the solution is rubbish. This code base demonstrates Object Oriented Programming using Python.  This is not efficient for many bodies, but since this is a sample and the number of bodies are small, it is the best way to implement it. The input values are random as are some of the calculated values.

This code sample demonstrates:
* Use of: Classes, Inheritance, Polymorphic behavior,
* Use of: Class Factory for demonstrating Object Oriented behavior,
* Input and output operations (csv in, stdout out),
* Minimal Unit testing, unit testing provides robustness for future changes.
* Use of Git for version control,
* Use of Markdown and READMEs for out of source docs,

This is a minimal set of code that isn't flexible and doesn't handle exceptions of any kind. This is just material to stimulate discussion during a technical interview. ;-)
